# Spam-email-machine-learning-model
Generate a machine learning model that classifies email as being spam or not spam.

Note for setting up 
* open SpamEmailML.ipynb on jupyter/machine learning studios
* make sure spambase.csv is in same folder (data file)
* can now run everything in the jupyter notebook

Project inspiration/goal
* develop a machine learning model that can detect spam emails
* spam emails are quite prevalent, and having this technology would save a persons time

Classification model used
* gaussian naive bayes since it is general used for this problem, and deals with continuous features well

Other
* this model is specific to the context of the data set provided (business context in usa), and is not in any way a general spam email filter that can be commercially used.
* data at - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase
* it provides a method that can be used to create a more general spam filter, but requires much more example emails/data

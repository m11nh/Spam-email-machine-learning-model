- set up environments

22/05/20
goal - complete setting up environment, read through specification, create plan to make sure things are crossed off, get started on coding

22/05/20
* set up environment - git, azure
* fix up data to csv
next up - figure out what is the best machine learning model/strategy to use considering there is only continuous features
naive baynes - https://www.dezyre.com/article/top-10-machine-learning-algorithms/202
Logistic regression - https://towardsdatascience.com/spam-detection-with-logistic-regression-23e3709e522
* get a general + some technical understanding of the naive bayes machine learning algorithm

23/05/20
* stuck with logistic regression
* completed model implementation with around 92% accuracy
Next - check accuracy with other methodologies + work on function that extracts needed data to put in classifier. 

24/05/2020
* completed model accuracy testing
* worked on a bit of the model implementation
Next - complete the 3rd part of checking input - frequency of capitals etc.

25/05/2020
* completed the implementation function 
next - make test cases, test them to get a general feed
     - comment code + move on with next steps
     - visualise results?

26/05/2020
* completed examples
* completed commenting
* completed readme
* will now submit 

todo later:
- comment my code clearly
- check all the checkpoints in spec to see i've completed
- submit
Info + resources
* potential models - naive bayes, logistic regression
